      <p>Heyho!</p>
      <p>As you could probably guess this is a website to calculate your kitchens, canteens, laundry etc.</p>
      <br>
      The website itself is made by me <a class="text-white-50" href="https://github.com/Montori">(Montori)</a> and the calculations were done by <a class="text-white-50" href="reddit.com/u/giantb">GiantB</a> based on his google sheet
      <br>
      If you want to check out the original google sheet you can click <a class="text-white-50" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NXZT3-Ebb9meEeVSpcQbvMTfpMV0qCN6KtHTE9ho1-s/edit#gid=646532267">here</a>!
